# OpenSimLSL
A Collection Of OpenSim Scripts In LSL

Some scripts in here will be trivial, some are much larger, they are all things I have found useful. 

If you wish to contribute to this repository please contact me. My only stipulation is that content contributed should be written in such a way that is is easy to read. Your methods should have clear names, as should your variables. If the purpose of your method/variable is not imediately clear is should be well commented. If you believe it could be used as a teaching tool them you are on the correct track. 

All Items in This repository made by me are relased under the following licence. Other Contributers may vary, so please check the licence inside each script
